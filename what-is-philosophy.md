What is philosophy? Put differently, what does the word "philosophy" mean? Here is a dictionary definition from Google: "the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline."

**The academic discipline of philosophy**

The [modern academic discipline of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) is mostly practiced at universities by paid professionals. Professional philosophers generally do some of the following:

* teach philosophy to students;
* publish journal articles, which are intended to be read by other professional philosophers and are often incomprehensible to laymen;
* publish books, usually targeted at other professional philosophers and often incomprehensible to laymen, but sometimes intended for a general audience;
* publish textbooks, primarily designed to be used in university classes;
* publish in the popular press;
* give talks, primarily to audiences of other professional philosophers, but also to the public.

What exactly do professional philosophers study and teach? All kinds of things! Based on my experience in the field, I would describe the subject of matter of academic philosophy as being anything whose study we haven't yet figured out how to systematize. This means that modern academic philosophers grapple mostly with very difficult questions, many of which we have grappled with for thousands of years without clear progress.

This conception of philosophy makes more sense given some historical context. In the 19th century, the creation of the modern research university led to the creation of a class of academic professionals, who were specialized into fields. One of these fields was "philosophy."

Prior to academic professionalization and specialization, "philosophy" in referred in Western usage to any body of knowledge. Post-specialization, philosophy became a specialized field answering a class of specifically "philosophical questions."

When professional philosophers talk about "philosophical questions," their usage is generally consistent with the interpretation "questions that belong to the academic field of philosophy." In other words, it's a question of jurisdiction. Should a question be answered by the methods of biology? If so, it's not a philosophical question; it's a biological question. Should a question be answered by proving a mathematical theorem? If so, it's not a philosophical question; it's a mathematical question. If no other field has jurisdiction over a question, then that's a philosophical question.

**Historical usage of "philosophy"**

We've seen that academic specialization introduced an interesting shift in the common usage of "philosophy," from referring to any body of knowledge to having a much more particular and narrow usage. This shift in language has buried some of the historical meanings of the term. Let's unbury some of these historical meanings.

"Philosophy" comes from the Greek *philosophia*, most commonly translated as "love of wisdom." *Philosophia* is a compound of *philo* and *sophia*. *Philo* is the combining form of *ph√≠los*, and it translates as "love of." *Sophia* means "wisdom," and it is related to *sophos*, which means ["wise," but also "clever," "skillful," "cunning," "able," "intelligent," and "prudent."](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%86%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)

To a modern ear, *sophos* is a highly multifaceted word. We draw much finer distinctions around types of mental capacity, and to us the word sounds nebulous and overloaded. What *philosophia* meant to the Ancient Greeks, however, seems to have taken in all of these different facets.

The word *sophisma* is derived from *sophos*, and derives the modern ["sophism."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophism)









It has meant different things to different people at different times, and so to explore the meaning of the word is to explore the history of the word. 

The word "philosophy" is derived from the Greek *philosophia*, which translates as "love of wisdom." Some Ancient Greeks were deeply dedicated to *philosophia*. In the Ancient Greek texts we can find accounts of philosophical schools, lively philosophical debates, and even social unrest and scandal caused by the practice of philosophy, as in [the story of the death of Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates#Trial_and_death, which is as fresh as ever today).

Socrates was a seminal promoter of philosophy, whose most important contribution was probably [the Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). The practitioner of the Socratic method uses targeted questions to lead an interlocutor to notice the flaws in their own beliefs. The Socratic method remains one of the most effective debate techniques ever developed. One of the beauties of it is that if the interlocutor is actually correct in their beliefs, the reasons why should emerge from the questions, so that either way the right side wins.

Socrates was notable as a man who dedicated his life to philosophy, living in poverty so he could spend his time on the pursuit of truth, and encouraging others to the same pursuit. He professed no wisdom and practiced sowing doubt and confusion in those who believed they understood things. The character of Socrates sets an example which it is still helpful to look to today.

Socrates reportedly attracted great annoyance from the people of Athens, and ultimately Athens executed Socrates for philosophizing. Modern-day people following in his footsteps, people who question people's unexamined beliefs, continue to annoy and attract retaliation.

From Ancient Greek times to the advent of modern research universities in the 19th century, the term "philosophy" was used to encompass knowledge in general. Research universities introduced academic specialization, and "philosophy" was understood in a new way as referring to a specialized field of study. The problems studied in academic philosophy today are essentially all problems whose study we have not systematized and extracted into a separate field. This means that modern academic philosophers grapple mostly with very difficult questions, many of which we have grappled with for thousands of years without clear progress.

I will not use the term "philosophy" synonymously with "academic philosophy." In reality philosophy is an activity which most people engage in to some extent. If you would like to see a simple example, get in a group of people and ask them whether hot dogs are a kind of sandwich. What I've observed when I ask this question is that usually people jump on it right away, and usually they make some of the same basic arguments for and against that I've heard in other groups. (Yes, because they're food in between bread. No, because they have a hinge. And so on.)

"Is a hot dog a sandwich?" is a philosophical question, even in the sense that if we studied it academically our field of study would be philosophy, because we have no system for answering questions like this. "Should abortion be legal?" is a philosophical question. "Should black Americans receive monetary reparations for slavery?" is a philosophical question. "Can I lead a happy life alone?" is a philosophical question.

These last few examples illustrate that philosophy is deeply important to our personal and political lives. Understanding philosophy in the sense of the study of questions we don't have systems for answering, philosophy is important because we don't have systems for answering many important questions.

I think, though, that some of the meaning of "philosophy" is lost if we just think of philosophy as those thinking activities analogous to the ones done in the academic field of philosophy. It is worth having a long memory and looking also to the historical meanings of the term to inform our present understanding.

Recall the literal meaning of the Greek root word *philosophia* is "love of wisdom." This etymology makes us think of Socrates' philosophy, which for him was a way of living and a great purpose. Later usage of "philosophy" uses it to mean knowledge in general. This usage fell out of favor with the specialization of academic research in modern universities.

The specialization in research universities has been critical for the development of modern knowledge, and its good effects far outweigh its bad effects in my judgment. However, it has resulted in a compartmentalization in academic pursuits and a relative shortage of general, integrative thought, at least in our academic institutions. The incentive structures of modern academic institutions do not encourage academics to try to convey understanding of the world as a whole in their works.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. Academic institutions may not be the best way to solve the problem of understanding the world in an integrative way, which is a highly individual effort. The structure of academia is a huge, collective effort where people try to produce solid knowledge which their peers agree is knowledge. Producing those kinds of results requires focusing on narrow questions and working hard to get them right.

What this approach doesn't do is give us wisdom. That's OK; research universities don't have to be where we get wisdom, and honestly they shouldn't be. Huge, monied bureaucracies controlled by a small professional class, while they've proven to be great for producing knowledge, aren't where we should try to seek our wisdom.

This is the reason we need to remember the historical meanings of "philosophy." By reflecting on the historical meanings of "philosophy" prior to academic professionalization and specialization, we can gain the understanding of philosophy not as a field of study, but as a mission, a value: the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge in general.

What is wisdom? Here are some truisms about wisdom. One needs life experience to obtain it. Judgments based on wisdom are more likely to be good. Wisdom is not easy to articulate or transfer; in this way wisdom is unlike knowledge. Uneducated people can be wise, and even highly educated people can be unwise.

This seems to be a relatively modern conception of wisdom. Our modern nomenclature draws a pretty clear distinction between knowledge and wisdom, where knowledge is factual, observable, easily communicable understanding about the world, and wisdom is inscrutable insight, sometimes perhaps bordering on irrational.



Socrates' wisdom was neither knowledge nor irrational. The Socratic method is not knowledge; it's a method, which helps you understand more and more things the more you practice it. It's like a well that never runs dry. But, the Socratic method is also easy to explain, and it's completely rational.

Another interesting case study in wisdom, very different from Socrates, is the [Tao Te Ching](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html). The Tao Te Ching is irrational wisdom, if it's wisdom at all. But like the Socratic method, it's a gift that keeps on giving, a book which provides vague insights about life in general which you can creatively specialize to your own situations.

If we examine other works that are considered wise, we find this quality of being a gift that keeps on giving to be common. Works of wisdom, when you read them, generally have a feeling of freshness and relevance, even if they are very old. (If they don't feel that way, that might be a sign they are overesteemed, or a sign that we're missing the point, or a sign that we already understand the point.)

Let's step back and ask a question we haven't asked. Is there such a thing as wisdom? Is there a kind of understanding which isn't easily articulable, which goes beyond and knowledge, and which doesn't depend on knowledge? Is wisdom merely a concept our parents used to brush aside arguments we had with them as children? A vague placeholder/free pass in place of an argument for why they were right? Is there wisdom, or is there just reason and articulable knowledge?

The common sense answer to this question is, of course there's such a thing as wisdom, and being blinded by knowledge and education to the importance of wisdom is unwise. But we should go deeper into the issue. Is there a thing which satisfies all of the truisms about wisdom listed previously? Is there something which satisfies some but not all of the truisms, enough that we could reasonably call it wisdom, but so that we might argue some of the truisms are false?








What is the place of wisdom in our society? How is wisdom sought? How do we view wisdom? Do we hold wisdom in high regard? Or do we place little value on wisdom? These are old questions, and asking them may sound preachy, but when do we talk about these issues outside of a religious context?

Socrates' injunction to examine our lives, throw out ignorance, and seek wisdom is as fresh and relevant as ever. From the texts on Socrates we get the image of an Athens which was ignorant and sleepy, which aggressively resisted Socrates' attempts to wake them up. How similar or different is this to the reactions you see to modern attempts to challenge flawed thinking?

The observation that wisdom is sometimes irrational needs to be treated with care. If we set up a turf war between rationality and wisdom, we will certainly lose. Our goal should be to harmonize rationality and wisdom, making our wisdom as rational as possible and our rationality as wise as possible.

Socrates provides us with some pieces of a model for seeking wisdom rationally. For Socrates, the most important thing is asking questions, examining our assumptions and expelling poor conceptions from our thinking.

Our focus in understanding intellectual progress is generally a focus on things that have been learned. Also important, though, are the things that we unlearn. A mind full of dogma is not fertile ground for insight. If you think you already have the answers, you will not seek the answers.

The opening in Western thinking that occurred in the Enlightenment, for example, was to a great extent a result of intellectuals discarding dogmas and appeals to authority in favor of trying to understand the world by investigating it.

The lesson to take from history here is that when asking how to move forward intellectually, we need to ask not just "what do I need to learn?" but also "what do I need to unlearn?" We need to develop a nose for the dogma in our heads, and we need to have the patience to follow through and clean up our beliefs by learning. It's not easy, and it's a lot of work.

Despite the continued relevance of the Socratic perspective, we have very different problems than those of ancient Athens and 18th century Europe. Much has not changed, but much has changed. The great paucity of information in the ancient Athenians' environment is a stark contrast to our modern situation of information saturation. The problem today for somebody who wants to grow their knowledge is not a lack of information, but an infathomable glut of information which makes understanding the world hard in a very different way.



















It would be confusing to modern speakers to refer to all knowledge as philosophy. It would be confusing, for example, to refer to science as philosophy.
