I am a neo-Socratic. I don't know anybody else who calls themselves a neo-Socratic. However, the term has a fairly clear pre-existing meaning. A neo-Socratic, roughly, is somebody who takes inspiration from Socrates in approaching modern problems. Let's try to find some neo-Socratics:

 * [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org/s/neo-socratic)
 * [Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8)

Not a lot to see here. Nobody in PhilPapers, the master bibliography of academic philosophy, who calls themselves a neo-Socratic. No living thinker who is called a neo-Socratic by other writers in sources on PhilPapers. These search results do show that [lots](http://securipedia.eu/mediawiki/index.php/Neosocratic_Dialogue) [of](http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/541) [people](http://www.mindboggles.org.za/index.php/neo-socratic-dialogues-in-school) like neo-Socratic dialogue (which as far as I can tell is essentially a different term for [the Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)). [Gabriel Marcel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Marcel) (1889-1973) called himself a neo-Socratic. [Some](https://www.absolutoracle.com/Neosocrates/Articles/articles.htm) [modern](https://www.peterlang.com/view/9783653999907/016_Chapter008.html) [thinkers](https://books.google.com/books?id=-dckCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=neo-socratic&source=bl&ots=vdaWBys7gZ&sig=r0qwOzgACtYcNxDOwodqWNE99Lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6y7Cv-N7QAhWFbSYKHVNhCEY4FBDoAQg-MAg#v=onepage&q=neo-socratic&f=false) use the term to describe their work and the work of others. However, none of these sources seem to articulate an overall philosophy which is distinctly neo-Socratic, in the sense of being founded on the work of Socrates.

What is it to be a neo-Socratic? Obviously a person could call themselves a neo-Socratic and mean any number of different specific things by that. Since people don't seem to be calling themselves neo-Socratics these days, these possible meanings are largely hypothetical. However, it is these possible meanings that are the subject of this essay. We are going to take a careful look at Socrates' life and thinking, see what questions his ideas pose for modern perspectives, see what principles of living might be consistent with the vision of life laid out by Socrates, and evaluate the pros and cons of such principles of living.

# Socratic thought

Obviously the first question is, what did Socrates think? Before we can ask how Socrates' ideas apply to the modern world, we must know what those ideas are.

Socrates left no writings for us himself. Our main sources for understanding him are Plato and Xenophon.

* Plato wrote [a number of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue#Platonic_dialogues) [dialogues](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:Greco-Roman) featuring Socrates as the protagonist. Ostensibly these are recordings of dialogues that actually occurred between the characters featured in them. However, this is unverifiable, and many historians suspect that Plato put words into the mouth of Socrates in many instances in his dialogues.
* Xenophon wrote a number of works about Socrates: **[Apology](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0212%3atext%3dApol.)**, **[Memorabilia](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0208)**, **[Symposium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0212%3atext%3dSym.)**, and **[Economics](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0212%3atext%3dEc.)**. 

Because we do not have the words of Socrates himself, it is hard for us to form a definite picture of his philosophy. We don't know where the available sources may be biased, may lie, or may omit important facts or viewpoints. Xenophon is considered a less biased source than Plato, because Xenophon was a historian, among other reasons.

Rather than attempting the futile and fairly pointless task of unearthing the "real Socrates," I will simply describe, first, Socrates' character and philosophy as portrayed by Xenophon; then, Socrates' character and philosophy as portrayed by Plato.

## Xenophon's Socrates

In this section, "Socrates" refers to Socrates as portrayed by Xenophon.

Socrates cared deeply about the ethical life and the intellectual life. He spent his time wandering around town discussing philosophy, particularly ethical and political philosophy, with anybody who would listen. He was highly scrupulous ethically, and used rational argumentation to persuade others to pursue ethical living.

Socrates lived on very little. He had no consistent source of income, because he spent his time doing philosophy with anybody who would engage with him, and unlike intellectual contemporaries such as the [sophists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophism), he did not charge money for his philosophical activities. He ate relatively little and relatively simple food, and he had few clothes. XXX: where did he live? However, he gave many reasons why his lifestyle was preferable to a richer lifestyle.

The overlying philosophy of Socrates' simple lifestyle was his emphasis on continence, meaning something like moderation and control of bodily impulses and drives.

* He recommended eating relatively little and relatively simple food, and eating only when one was hungry. He argued this led to greater enjoyment of food. He argued that people who ate lots of fancy food were driven to fancy foods because their appetite was blunted by overeating, and that it was harder for them to enjoy eating.
* He recommended maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and not oversleeping. He ridiculed people who slept more than necessary, for pleasure, and used not getting enough sleep as an excuse for flaking on obligations. He argued that maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is a good prevention for insomnia and fatigue.
* He recommended avoiding sexual activity, especially with physically attractive people. He issued dire warnings against becoming emotionally involved with attractive people, going so far as to recommend avoiding associating with especially attractive people altogether. (One should wonder, though, how this statement would make attractive people feel.) He argued that emotional involvements with attractive people tended to make people behave irrationally and immoderately, and to lead to painful emotional wounds which took a very long time to heal.
* He recommended having few and simple clothes, and allowing one's body to become habituated to different forms of weather so that they were not uncomfortable. One should note in this connection that going out into severe cold with inadequate clothing can result in death and other medical problems from [hypothermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia).

By not charging money for his philosophical activity, Socrates said that he retained the freedom to spend his time talking to whom he wanted to talk. He compared his situation to that of the contemporary sophists, who by charging for their services were forced to spend their time with those who would pay, predominantly the wealthy upper classes.

Socrates said that it was easy for him to get what he needed, because his needs were so simple. His primary need seems to have been food, and he only required small quantities of inexpensive food, which he reportedly obtained easily, most likely through charity and possibly foraging.
