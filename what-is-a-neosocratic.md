I am a neo-Socratic. I don't know anybody else who calls themselves a neo-Socratic. However, the term has a fairly clear pre-existing meaning. A neo-Socratic, roughly, is somebody who takes inspiration from Socrates in approaching modern problems. Let's try to find some neo-Socratics:

 * [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org/s/neo-socratic)
 * [Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8)

Not a lot to see here. Nobody in PhilPapers, the master bibliography of academic philosophy, who calls themselves a neo-Socratic. No living thinker who is called a neo-Socratic by other writers in sources on PhilPapers. These search results do show that [lots](http://securipedia.eu/mediawiki/index.php/Neosocratic_Dialogue) [of](http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/541) [people](http://www.mindboggles.org.za/index.php/neo-socratic-dialogues-in-school) like neo-Socratic dialogue (which as far as I can tell is essentially the same thing as [the Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)). [Gabriel Marcel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Marcel) (1889-1973) called himself a neo-Socratic. [Some](https://www.absolutoracle.com/Neosocrates/Articles/articles.htm) [modern](https://www.peterlang.com/view/9783653999907/016_Chapter008.html) [thinkers](https://books.google.com/books?id=-dckCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=neo-socratic&source=bl&ots=vdaWBys7gZ&sig=r0qwOzgACtYcNxDOwodqWNE99Lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6y7Cv-N7QAhWFbSYKHVNhCEY4FBDoAQg-MAg#v=onepage&q=neo-socratic&f=false) use the term to describe their work and the work of others. However, none of these sources seem to articulate an overall philosophy which is distinctly neo-Socratic, in the sense of being founded on the work of Socrates.

What is it to be a neo-Socratic? Obviously a person could call themselves a neo-Socratic and mean any number of different specific things by that. However, there would be some common threads in all of the reasonable meanings. There are a great variety of things in the [first few pages of Google results for "neo-socratic."](https://www.google.com/?q=neo-socratic). Probably the most common thread is the use of neo-Socratic dialogue in addressing various public and social problems.

That said, I am not trying to describe an existing neo-Socratic movement; rather, I aim to describe an area of opportunity. I don't claim, of course, that the neo-Socratic ideas I'm presenting are new. Socrates is old and well-known, and his ideas are well-assimilated into our culture. However, I also think that there is great wealth in Socratic thought which modern society has not capitalized upon. Therefore I aim to present a vision of the opportunities Socratic thought presents for modern people.

# Socratic thought

Obviously the first question is, what did Socrates think? Before we can ask how Socrates' ideas apply to the modern world, we must know what those ideas are.

When we speak of Socrates' philosophy, this is often a figurative reference, because most of what we know about Socrates' philosophy comes from the writings of his student Plato (Socrates having written nothing himself). It is usually impossible to tell whether any given passage represents something Socrates really said, or something Plato put into Socrates' mouth. As a matter of convenience, we will usually not worry about this distinction.

Our concern is not so much with the historical Socrates, as with the myth of Socrates established by the writings of Plato. This myth, even if it contains a lot of fiction and distortion, is in my opinion a great source of wisdom, which is still fresh and relevant today. Where it's factually accurate, and where it isn't, is largely irrelevant, because the important thing is the merit and applicability of the philosophical ideas contained in the myth.

Therefore, unless context makes the opposite clear, "Socrates" refers in this post to the Platonic, mythical Socrates, and not to the historical Socrates. It should be understood that many characteristics of the Platonic, mythical Socrates can be corroborated by historical evidence, in particular the [writings of Xenophon on Socrates](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674996953), which are considered a less biased source than Plato. Because I am not an Ancient Greek scholar, I won't try to say which aspects of the myth are and are not historically accurate.

Socrates cared deeply about ethics. His chosen methods of fighting injustice were setting a good moral example, and arguing via the Socratic method in favor of virtuous life. He would argue in person, in his community, tailoring his discussion to the persons present. He would argue with anybody who would listen.

Socrates cared deeply about the intellectual life, which he saw as closely connected with the virtuous, moral life. He believed that one could recognize the preferability of virtuous life on intellectual grounds, and even from a self-interested perspective. He believed that philosophy was necessary both to uncover the nature of virtuous life, and to argue for its correctness in the public sphere.
